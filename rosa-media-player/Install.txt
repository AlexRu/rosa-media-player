This document explains how to compile and install rosa-media-player.

Compiling rosa-media-player should be easy. It only depends on Qt. Since version 1.0
it can only be compiled with Qt 4.2 or greater.


1) How to make a rpm package
2) Generic compilation
3) Changing installation path


1) How to make a rpm package
----------------------------
Run rpmbuild -tb rosa-media-player-1.5.x.tar.gz
You'll find the rpm pachage under /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i586/


2) Generic compilation
----------------------
You need at least Qt 4.2 to compile rosa-media-player. It won't work with an older
version.

Be sure you have installed the Qt 4 development package. Its name maybe
qt4-devel, libqt4-dev or similar. 

Uncompress the source code, open a console and enter in the 
rosa-media-player-1.5.x directory.

Type "make". 

If everything is ok now you can install it with "make install".
That will install rosa-media-player in /usr/local.

If "make" fails, it's probably because the Qt 3 qmake has been used instead of
the Qt 4 one. It seems that some distros have renamed that tool to qmake-qt4. 
Others may have installed in another directory.
Look at the contents of the qt4-devel package (or whatever its name is) and
find out where it is.

Now type something like this (just examples):
make QMAKE=qmake-qt4
or
make QMAKE=/usr/share/qt4/bin/qmake


3) Changing installation path
-----------------------------
By default rosa-media-player will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX and DESTDIR.

Examples:
make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr install

That would install rosa-media-player under /usr.

DESTDIR will be useful for package maintainers.

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

That would compile rosa-media-player for /usr but in fact it will be installed in
/tmp/usr/
